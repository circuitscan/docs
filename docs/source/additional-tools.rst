Additional Tools
================

Circuitscan modules
-------------------

* `Circuitscan pipeline runner <https://github.com/circuitscan/circuitscan-pipeline-runner>`_ NPM package for constructing compilation pipelines that integrate into the Circuitscan cloud infrastructure, producing build artifacts for any circuit language that can generate Solidity verifiers

* `SnarkJS Groth16 Multi-verifier <https://github.com/circuitscan/snarkjs-groth16-multi-verifier>`_ NPM package for combining multiple similar Groth16 verifiers into one contract

* `Verified Solidity Source <https://github.com/circuitscan/verified-solidity-source>`_ NPM package to fetch the Solidity source code of a contract deployed on chain from Sourcify or Etherscan

Third-party tools
-----------------

* `Circomkit <https://github.com/erhant/circomkit>`_ NPM package to simplify the process of testing and developing Circom circuits

* `P0tion <https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/p0tion>`_ CLI and web app for public phase-two trusted setup ceremonies for Groth16 verifiers

* `Circomspect <https://github.com/trailofbits/circomspect>`_ static analyzer for Circom sources
